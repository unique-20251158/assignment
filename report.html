            <div class="heading">My Web Development Journey</div>
            <div class="content">
                I first started this module in my 1st year of bachelors level , I had very little knowledge abt HTML also i had studied about the basics of html during my highschool time. The idea of building a complete portfolio website from scratch was a bit hard at the first. However, as the days progressed, I began to understand the fundamental concepts of web development and how different elements work together to create a functional website for eg:- usage of the tags and css properties.

            <div class="content">
                Learning HTML was like learning a new language. At first, remembering all the tags and their purpose was challenging but as i moved on and kept on practicing it became quite easy and regular for me .The breakthrough moment came when I came to realize that HTML is essentially just English text organized and structured using tags. Once I realized this writing markups became much easier.

            <div class="content">
                For my portfolio's color scheme, I chose a professional blue theme with dark grey/charcol grey colour for contrast. Blue because its my favourite colour and it also show professionalism as they say, which I felt was appropriate for a portfolio showcasing my work. The white background ensures readability while keeping the design clean,modern and simple.

            <div class="content">
                I selected Arial as my font family because it looks clean, simple, and is widely used across all different websites i've visited and came through.The font sizes are easy to follow with 60px for main titles for better visibility also, 35px for section headers, and 20px for body text, making the site look clean and consistent.

            <div class="content">
                One of my biggest challenges faced was implementing responsive design for small screen devices. Initially, my website looked good to go on desktop but looked not ok on mobile devices. For that I used 768px and 480px points so the site works well on tablets and phones to get that responsive view.

            <div class="content">
        The another challange i faced was duirng making contact form . Getting the layout to work properly with flexbox required lots of attempts. So for that i had to use proper use of margins, padding, and the flex properties that can create decent looking form. I had to do lots of debugging where i wasted a lot of time however the process taught me using browser developer tools to check elements and try CSS changes in real time which is gonna save me a lot of time the next time.

            <div class="content">
                Looking back at this , I am proud of how much I have grown and learned in this module . The good parts were seeing my first responsive layout work and feeling excited when my contact form finally worked. The hard parts were spending long hours debugging my contact form CSS where even one small mistake could break the whole form.

            <div class="content">
                This experience has taught me the importance of patience and systematic debugging in web development especially. I now understand that building websites is not just about writing code it's about creating user experiences creativity that works well and looks good too.

            <div class="heading">Influences</div>
            <div class="content">
                My design was influenced from looking up different other portfolios and i drawing up a sample sketch on my own to give it my own touch and was also inspired by clean and simple designs, so I focused on using space wisely and keeping the text easy to read. For the project page, I followed the style of portfolio websites that display work in a neat, gallery-like layout.
